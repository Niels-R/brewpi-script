If the arduino is running the simulator, the script automatically switches over to simulator mode.

- On startup, the initialJson config value is read and sent to the arduino on startup. This is typically used to set the
- Existing JSON files are overwritten. Thiis is intentional to allow multiple restarts in case the params are wrong.
-

- The profile spreadsheet can also contain simulator parameters
- The simulator uses the set after X days rather than the absolute time. Restarts of the script do not append to new files.
